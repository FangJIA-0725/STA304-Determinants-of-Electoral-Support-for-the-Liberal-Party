## Non technical summary

Voters play important roles in voting for different Parties in Canadian Elections. Our company is working for Liberal Party and provides them monthly polling updates in the overall election. We use the latest survey's data to explore if gender, age group, sexuality and economic class of income will lead voters to vote Liberal Party overall elections. We find that females, elderly groups and middle class groups play important roles in voting for Liberal Party while sexuality doesn't. These findings will help the Liberal Party to get a basic understanding of which group of people are more likely to support them. The report has some weakness such as data bias and respondent error. We will use more survey methods to get a larger sample size in the future.


## Introudction

In this paper, we investigate the polling data from the survey about age, gender, sexuality and income of voters who voted for Liberal Party. The purpose for this report is to explore if those factors will mainly affect the results of voting the Liberal Party. After all, our company hope the Liberal Party can get more supports by finding out what they could focus on and what they could improve. From the survey data we observe that female, over 61 ages group and middle class with household income 30,001-11,001 are three main groups who voted for the Liberal Party. All these survey data are referenced from real world parameter[1]. 

There are four questions in this survey which ask your gender, sexuality, income and age group. We collect 5000 respondents regarding to four questions in survey. To make the observation more clear and easier to analyze, we make a data frame with four columns of variables and plot these variables into 4 graphs. Each graph shows a variable from gender, income, age and sexuality in x-axis and total count of 5000 in y-axis.

In the following paper, it is contained four parts. First one is survey methodology. It describes which sampling method used in this paper,how we collect the data and estimate the cost of surveying. The second part which is data information summaries 5000 people's choice according to four questions in the survey. Thirdly, we explain the distribution of result. Fourthly, we conclude the result and explain how to improve the weakness.


## Survey methodology

The target population for this survey is all Canadian citizens vote for liberal political party in the overall election. The frame for this survey is the list of all Canadian citizens vote for liberal political party in the overall election and registered at Election Canada office. We can find the list of all Canadian citizens who vote for liberal political party in the overall election from Election Canada office. Then we choose 5000 Canadian citizens in this list as sample.

We will use simple random sampling with replacement. We send out 5000 survey to public and each person can change their answer at any time. It is more easier to analyze a smaller sample size from a larger population. Each unit have equal chance to be selected from population. Using simple random sampling method, we can know the approximate age distribution of the citizens who have right to vote for liberal party. In additional we can analyze what kind of factors the citizens prefer to consider when they vote for the liberal party.

About methods of survey, we choose online surveys to receive different groups of respondents as complete as possible. The advantages of this method is economical and convenient. For the online survey. We've made 4 brief multiple choice questions on the surveymonkey website. Online survey can increase response rate easily because most people more likely providing reasonable answers compare face to face survey method. For the online survey by surveymonkey website, the total cost will be $32,200[2]. The price per response is $6.44 and the sample size is limited to 5000. So the total price for this survey is $32,200.

While we collecting data, non response is always unavoidable. We can enlarge sample size and use more survey methods to deal with non response. By enlarging sample size, the non response will relatively smaller. By adding more survey methods, we could collect different types of people's data. If a particular group is under or over-represented in the survey due to non-response, the results may be not fair. For instance, if the group of respondents whose occupation lawyers refuse to respond, it will lead to biases in the estimates. To prevent this situation, we have to guarantee the diversity of samples.

To protect respondent privacy, firstly we keep the survey anonymous. The information when submitting the questionnaire( the IP address for logging in, time for submitting) and survey data will bot be shared by the third party. All information will be used for survey purpose. We will notice the respondents that we do not have the right to use their data for other uses except for survey. Secondly, there is no obligation for respondents to provide personal information. We do not have any mandatory personal queonstion or pressure for collecting privacy information in the questionnaire. Most importantly, respondents have the rights to decide whether to provide their information or not. Thirdly, we allow respondents keep the right to achieve their response after the survey is submitted. They have rights to change their answers at any time and we respect their rights to withdraw their submission at any time.

## Dataset information

The following dataframe has 4 columns and 5000 rows. Each row represents a particular respondent who answer the survey questions. There are 5,000 respondents in total. Each column represents each survey questions. They are household income class group,age group, gender and sexuality group. Each listed following number represents a respondent's choice corresponding to the question. In addition, the order of numbers in each column represents the order of choice from each survey questions. For example, the number 5 in age_count column means the respondent choose the fifth choice of age group, which is over 61^[3].

# Graph Discussion of Figure 1
The figure 1 represents the data collected from first survey questions "What is your age". For the first question in the survey, we record how many people choose age range among 5 choices. Then we use simulated data to get distribution of 5 age range. The distribution of Figure 1 is left-skewed.

There is relatively small difference in the number of people in the age range of 18-30,31-40,41-50 and 51-60. However, the number of people choose over 61 age range among 5 choices is the most, which is 1805. From the data, we can see that large number of elderly people voted for the Liberal Party and it might be due to the policies that the candidate of Liberal Party has made. The political party also pay attention to those elders and has made effective policies in term of pension insurance, and it might be the reason for those elders to vote for them.

# Graph Discussion figure 2

To analyze how income would affect the result of the Federal Party Election, we record 5000 people's income range. Figure 2 is approximately normal distribution. 1611 people have an average household salary of $30,001 to $70,000 , followed by 1500 people who earned $70,001 to $110,000 in a year.  Relatively, the number of people earned income at range of 0 - 30000, 110001 - 150000 and over 150001 is small compare with income range of $30,001 to $70,000 and $70,001 to $110,000.

According to the average Canadian salary income in 2019, the average income for Canadian was $52,600 per year. From the simulated data, we found that those people with relatively middle income prefer to vote for Liberal Party. The following policy might affect the result of election. Liberal Party decided to raise the tax on the wealthiest people and cut taxes for the middle class. Therefore, income might be one of the reasons for the participants to make their choices.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
# create a table with how many people choose female or male, 1 represents female, 2 represents male 
set.seed(6138)
gender_count_1 <- table(sample(0:1,5000,replace=TRUE, prob = c(female,male)))

       subtitle = "Gender is catogried into female and male",

```
# Graph Discussion figure 3

According to the data we have collected, there are 2907 females and 2093 males who support liberal party. The results of recent polls show that Canada and Canadian men and women have significantly different voting intentions. Men usually pay more attention to the acquisition of benefits, while women overemphasize human nature to varying degrees.
In the bipartisan competition, their actual promised returns are similar, so the support rate of men is almost equal.

Male prefer choose the Liberal Party because they offer more attractive policies to ordinary people. For example, the most important policy is a tax cut for people with an annual income of less than £147,000. In fact,most families especially Chinese families earn less than 147,000 pounds. If the Liberal Party cuts taxes for these families, they hope to save a lot every year.

The following policy may increase interest of woman voting for liberal party. Trudeau, the representative of the Liberal Party, has successfully fulfilled his promise to provide more support to survivors of sexual harassment, sexual assault and domestic violence. He promised to develop a comprehensive national strategy to combat gender-based violence, consider gender impact in all government decisions, and launch a national investigation to understand the prevalence of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. In addition, the rights and interests of the LGBT community in Canada have recently been more comprehensively protected by the Liberal Party, and the new policy has improved the welfare of the elderly and children.

```
# Graph Discussion figure 4

We also discuss about whether sexuality can be one of the reasons that make those participants to vote for Liberal party. From the data we simulated, it is obvious that the graph is right-skewed and 4644 number of people are heterosexual. Then, there are 214 people are bisexual and 142 participants prefer not to say. It's a normal result as we can predict because bisexual group only take small proportion of the whole sexuality in Canada. Although the Liberal party voted to maintain current policies on same-sex marriage, it seems that this action did not have a big influence in the Federal Party Election.




## Conclusion

According to figure 1, figure 2, figure 3 and figure 4. We summarize that the gender, class of income and age group play important role in voting Liberal Party. Especially the elderly group, female group and middle class group provide most supports to the Liberal Party. This is based on different politics published by Liberal Party. We can predict that the liberal party will continue receiving supports from female, elderly citizens and middle-class citizens in next election. 

However other groups of people provide less percentage of support on voting liberal party. For example, Liberal Party is extremely popular in middle class but receives a little proportion of support from upper and lower class. According to the analysis of figure 2, the Liberal Party not only cuts taxes for middle class but also increases taxes for upper class. Some people from upper class will think it is not fair for them about the growth of taxes. They work hard everyday but still face such a "balanced" policy. Therefore I recommend the Liberal Party should consider how to adjust the tax policy and make a better deal for all economic classes. Other groups of people with a low percentage of support to Liberal Party election may have same properties of reasons as upper-class. So I suggest the liberal party should focus on those groups with low percentage in voting liberal party. They can spend more time on investigating and publishing some better policies so that they will get more support at next election.

In a word, the Liberal Party should not only keep those voters who have already voted the liberals but also pay attention to adjust some policies to attract other groups for voting the liberal party in the future.

## Weakness and future step


There are two weakness I would like to work on in the future, First weakness is data limitation. The data we used is updated monthly. So what we are analyzing right now is from the past data. It means we can have a complete analysis based on the past data but we can not use these data to predict the Canadian Polling Election's result in the future. Because data can be changed during updates which lead the result we predict be less precise. The second reason is respondent error. This can be divided to two parts. There are still other groups of people who doesn't have chance to answer online survey such as over 80 yrs old people or people with disability. It leads the distribution of data being not precise as well. On the other hand, some respondents prefer not to answer survey questions or provide unreasonable answers which will cause data bias and lead us getting a wrong conclusion.

In future, to reduce the errors we mentioned, we will try our best to enlarge the sample size. We will use more survey methods instead of only taking online survey so that there will be more different groups of people who can take survey and give us answers. In this way, the respondent bias can be reduced and we can get a more real analysis of data. Also, due to the limitation of data, I think we need to get more updated data in the future so that we can compare difference between these data and get a more accurate result.
